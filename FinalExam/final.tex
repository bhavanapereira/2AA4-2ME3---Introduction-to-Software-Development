\textbf{Special Instructions}:

\begin{enumerate}

\item For taking tests remotely: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Turn off all unnecessary programs, especially Netflix, YouTube, games like
  Xbox or PS4, anything that might be downloading or streaming.
\item If your house is shared, ask others to refrain from doing those activities
  during the test.
\item If you can, connect to the internet via a wired connection.
\item Move close to the Wi-Fi hub in your house. 
\item Restart your computer, 1-2 hours before the exam. A restart can be very
  helpful for several computer hiccups.
\item Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) since this improves the connection to
  the CAS servers.
\item Commit and push your tex file, compiled pdf file, and code files
  frequently.  As a minimum you should do a commit and push after completing
  each question.
\item Ensure that you push your solution (tex file, pdf file and code files)
  before time expires on the test.  The solution that is in the repo at the
  deadline is the solution that will be graded.
\item If you have trouble with your git repo, the quickest solution may be to
  create a fresh clone.
\end{itemize}
\item It is your responsibility to ensure that the answer sheet is properly
  completed. Your examination result depends upon proper attention to the
  instructions.
\item All physical external resources are permitted, including textbooks, calculators,
  computers, compilers, and the internet.
\item The work has to be completed individually.  Discussion with others is
  strictly prohibited.
\item Read each question carefully.
\item Try to allocate your time sensibly and divide it appropriately between the
  questions.  Use the allocated marks as a guide on how to divide your time
  between questions.
\item The quality of written answers will be considered during grading.  Please
  make your answers well-written and succinct.
\item The set $\mathbb{N}$ is assumed to include $0$.

\question{5 marks} Critique the following requirements specification
for a new cell phone application, called CellApp.  Use the following criteria
discussed in class for judging the quality of the specification: abstract,
unambiguous, and validatable.  How could you improve the requirements
specification?

\bigskip

``The user shall find CellApp easy to use.''

\bigskip

\noindent \wss{Fill in the itemized list below with your answers.  Leave the
  word in bold at the beginning of each item.}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Abstract} - This specification is abstract in that it tells the developer the "what" such that the program should be easy to use, however it does not tell the developer the "how". By not providing the "how", the specification leaves an open opportunity to for the developer to go about "making the CellApp easy to use" in a way that they feel fit. Based on the full abstraction, however, the developer is left to make assumptions which leads to ambiguity as discussed in the next point. 
\item \textbf{Unambiguous} - The terms "easy to use" or "user friendly" as extremely ambiguous. The developer does not know who the target user is, they may come from a different age range, technical background, etc. It is very subjective to say user friendly; what may be easy to use for one person can be difficult to use by another. 
\item \textbf{Validatable} - Tying closely to ambiguity, it is difficult to measure validability of this specification. By the subjectivity of the specification, the developer may find it difficult to test or measure success and failure in meeting the requirement. The ambiguity of this specification leads to misunderstanding between the developer and the client, such that even though the developer may find it user-friendly, the client may not and for this reason a viable test cannot take place to validate the requirement. 
\item \textbf{How to improve} - There are ways to improve this specification, by clearly identifying what the client considers "user-friendly". Extend the context by requiring, perhaps, "a certain amount of clicks made by the user", or testing by implementing surveys for user feedback. In doing so, the developer and client may come to a clearer agreement and the developer is one step closer to ensuring that they are making the right product

\question{5 marks} The following module is proposed for the maze tracing robot
we discussed in class (L20).  This module is a leaf module in the decomposition
by secrets hierarchy.

\begin{description}
\item [Module Name] find\_path
\item [Module Secret] The data structure and algorithm for finding the shortest
  path in a graph.
\end{description}

\noindent \wss{Fill in the answers to the questions below.  For each item you
  should leave the bold question and write your answer directly after it.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Is this module Hardware Hiding, Software Decision Hiding or
    Behaviour Hiding?  Why?}

  - This module falls under Software Decision Hiding. Noting that the software requirements specification (SRS) is abstract, the developer becomes more concrete in the Module Guide, then more concrete in the MIS, and then even more concrete in the actual code. Decisions, such as determining the algorithm and data structure for the shortest path, fall under the category of Software Decision hiding in that it makes the service less abstract. Modules such as this provide generic services that can be used elsewhere if need be. Services such as this, solve the ODE. 

\item \textbf{Is this a good secret?  Why?}

  - This is not a good secret. The secret uses nouns such as "data structure" and "algorithm" which is efficient, but it fails to adhere to having one secret for one module. By using "and", the secret suggests that the module implements both the data structure and algorithm for finding the shortest path, leaving it two responsibilities. It would be better to split this into two modules; one for the data structure for finding the shortest path, and one for the algorithm for finding the shortest path. By having too many secrets, the module risks not being cohesive.  

\item \textbf{Does the specification for maze tracing robot require environment
    variables?  If so, which environment variables are needed?}

  - answer here

\question{5 marks} Answer the following questions assuming that you are in doing
your final year capstone in a group of 5 students.  Your project is to write a
video game for playing chess, either over the network between two human
opponents, or locally between a human and an Artificial Intelligence (AI)
opponent.

\bigskip

\noindent \wss{Fill in the answers to the questions below.  For each item you
  should leave the bold question and write your answer directly after it.}

\begin{enumerate}
  
\item \textbf{You have 8 months to work on the project.  Keeping in mind that we
  usually need to fake a rational design process, what major milestones and what
  timeline for achieving these milestones do you propose?  You can indicate the
  time a milestone is reached by the number of months from the project's start date.}

  - answer here
  
\item \textbf{Everything in your process should be verified, including the
    verification.  How might you verify your verification?}

  - Mutant testing is a feasible method of verifying the verification. By using employing the "Potato Lake" method, this artifical seeding of faults aids in discovering both seeded and new faults, which is used to estimate the total number of errors or faults in the code. Through this, we can grasp and assume that the proability of errors (total) is proportional to the number of errors already found with respect to the whole program. Mutation testing can be done by generating simple changes to the source code, which become faults. This can be done by modifying operations and constants or by changing the order of certain executions. It is not guaranteed that all of these modifications will produce an error, but it is safe to assume the majority of them will. We can ultimately establish the adequacy of our Test Set from from running our tests on each of our generate faults (mutants).
  
\item \textbf{How do you propose verifying the installability of your game?}

    hours do you estimate that your team has available for verification related
    activities?  Please justify your answer.}

\item \textbf{Given the estimated hours available for verification, what verification
    techniques do you recommend for your team?  Please list the techniques,

\question{5 marks} Consider the following natural language specification for a
function that looks for resonance when the input matches an integer multiple of
the wavelengths 5 and 7. Provided an integer input between 1 and 1000, the
function returns a string as specified below:

\begin{itemize}
\item If the number is a multiple of 5, then the output is “resonance 5”
\item If the number is a multiple of 7, then the output is “resonance 7”
\item If the number is a multiple of both 5 and 7, then the output is “resonance
  5 and 7”
\item Otherwise, the output is “no resonance”
\end{itemize}

You can assume that inputs outside of the range 1 to 1000 do not occur.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What are the sets $D_i$ that partition $D$ (the input domain) into a
  reasonable set of equivalence classes?

  \wss{answer here - you can answer in natural language, or using mathematical
    notation.}

\item Given the sets $D_i$, and the heuristics discussed in class, how would you
  go about selecting test cases?

  \wss{answer here - you don't need specific test cases; your answer should
    characterize how all significant test cases are to be chosen.}

\question{5 marks} For this question you will implement in Java an ADT for a 1D
sequence of real numbers.  We want to take the mean of the numbers in the
sequence, but as the following web-page shows, there are several different
algorithms for doing this: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_mean}

Given that there are different options, we will use the strategy design pattern,
as illustrated in the following UML diagram:

\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Seq1D_Mean_Strategy_UML.png}
\end{center}
\caption{UML Class Diagram for Seq1D with Mean Function, using Strategy
  Pattern} \label{Fig_UML_Strategy}
\end{figure}

You will need to fill in the following blank files:
\texttt{MeanCalculator.java}, \texttt{HarmonicMean.java},
\texttt{QuadraticMean.java}, and \texttt{Seq1D.java}.  Two testing files are
also provided: \texttt{Expt.java} and \texttt{TestSeq1D.java}.  The file
\texttt{Expt.java} is pre-populated with some simple experiments to help you see
the interface in use, and do some initial testing.  You are free to add to this
file to experiment with your work, but the file itself isn't graded.  The
\texttt{TestSeq1D.java} is also not graded.  However, you may want to create
test cases to improve your confidence in your solution.  The stubs of the
necessary files are already available in your \texttt{src} folder.  The code
will automatically be imported into this document when the \texttt{tex} file is
compiled.  You should use the provided Makefile to test your code.  You will NOT
need to modify the Makefile.  The given Makefile will work for \texttt{make
  test}, without errors, from the initial state of your repo.  The \texttt{make
  expt} rule will also work, because all lines of code have been commented out.
Uncomment lines as you complete work on each part of the modules relevant to
those lines in \texttt{Expt.java} file.  As usual, the final test is whether the
code runs on mills.  You do not need to worry about doxygen comments.

Any exceptions in the specification have names identical to the expected Java
exceptions; your code should use exactly the exception names as given in the
spec.

Remember, your code needs to implement the given specification so that the
interface behaves as specified.  This does NOT mean that the local functions
need to all be implemented, or that the types used internally to the spec need
to be implemented exactly as given.  If you do implement any local functions,
please make them private.  The real type in the MIS should be implemented by
\texttt{Double} (capital D) in Java.

\wss{Complete Java code to match the following specification.}
